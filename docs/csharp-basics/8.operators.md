## Operators

In C#, operators are special symbols that perform operations on one or more operands. They are essential for performing calculations, making decisions, and manipulating data. Operators in C# can be categorized into several types: arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and more. Letâ€™s explore these operators in detail.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used for basic mathematical operations. They work with numeric types like `int`, `float`, `double`, etc.

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.

  ```csharp
  int sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8
  ```

- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.

  ```csharp
  int difference = 5 - 3; // difference is 2
  ```

- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.

  ```csharp
  int product = 5 * 3; // product is 15
  ```

- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first operand by the second.

  ```csharp
  int quotient = 15 / 3; // quotient is 5
  ```

- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division.

  ```csharp
  int remainder = 5 % 3; // remainder is 2
  ```

### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two operands are equal.

  ```csharp
  bool isEqual = (5 == 5); // isEqual is true
  ```

- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.

  ```csharp
  bool isNotEqual = (5 != 3); // isNotEqual is true
  ```

- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.

  ```csharp
  bool isGreater = (5 > 3); // isGreater is true
  ```

- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the first operand is less than the second.

  ```csharp
  bool isLess = (3 < 5); // isLess is true
  ```

- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.

  ```csharp
  bool isGreaterOrEqual = (5 >= 5); // isGreaterOrEqual is true
  ```

- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.

  ```csharp
  bool isLessOrEqual = (3 <= 5); // isLessOrEqual is true
  ```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return a boolean result.

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.

  ```csharp
  bool result = (5 > 3) && (3 < 5); // result is true
  ```

- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`.

  ```csharp
  bool result = (5 > 3) || (3 > 5); // result is true
  ```

- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the boolean value of the operand.

  ```csharp
  bool result = !(5 > 3); // result is false
  ```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of integers.

- **AND (`&`)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation.

  ```csharp
  int result = 5 & 3; // result is 1 (0101 & 0011 = 0001)
  ```

- **OR (`|`)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation.

  ```csharp
  int result = 5 | 3; // result is 7 (0101 | 0011 = 0111)
  ```

- **XOR (`^`)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation.

  ```csharp
  int result = 5 ^ 3; // result is 6 (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110)
  ```

- **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of the operand.

  ```csharp
  int result = ~5; // result is -6 (bitwise complement of 0101 is 1010, which is -6 in two's complement)
  ```

- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of the first operand left by the number of positions specified by the second operand.

  ```csharp
  int result = 5 << 1; // result is 10 (0101 << 1 = 1010)
  ```

- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of the first operand right by the number of positions specified by the second operand.

  ```csharp
  int result = 5 >> 1; // result is 2 (0101 >> 1 = 0010)
  ```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also combine assignment with another operation.

- **Simple assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.

  ```csharp
  int a = 5;
  ```

- **Add and assign (`+=`)**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

  ```csharp
  a += 3; // equivalent to a = a + 3; a is now 8
  ```

- **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

  ```csharp
  a -= 2; // equivalent to a = a - 2; a is now 6
  ```

- **Multiply and assign (`*=`)**: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

  ```csharp
  a *= 2; // equivalent to a = a * 2; a is now 12
  ```

- **Divide and assign (`/=`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

  ```csharp
  a /= 3; // equivalent to a = a / 3; a is now 4
  ```

- **Modulus and assign (`%=`)**: Computes the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

  ```csharp
  a %= 3; // equivalent to a = a % 3; a is now 1
  ```

### Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The conditional operator (`? :`) is a shorthand for `if-else` statements.

```csharp
int a = 10;
string result = (a > 5) ? "Greater than 5" : "Less than or equal to 5"; // result is "Greater than 5"
```

### Null-Coalescing Operators

These operators are useful for dealing with null values.

- **Null-coalescing operator (`??`)**: Returns the left operand if it is not null; otherwise, it returns the right operand.

  ```csharp
  string s = null;
  string result = s ?? "Default value"; // result is "Default value"
  ```

- **Null-coalescing assignment operator (`??=`)**: Assigns the right operand to the left operand only if the left operand is null.

  ```csharp
  string s = null;
  s ??= "Default value"; // s is now "Default value"
  ```

### Summary

Operators in C# provide the building blocks for performing a wide range of operations, from simple arithmetic to complex logical and bitwise manipulations. Understanding these operators and how to use them effectively is crucial for writing efficient and effective C# code. By mastering these operators, you can perform tasks more succinctly and clearly, making your code easier to read and maintain.
