## Scope

### 1. Block Scope

Block scope is the most restrictive type of scope. It refers to the area within a set of curly braces `{}`. Variables declared within a block are only accessible within that block.

```csharp
public void BlockScopeExample()
{
    int x = 10; // x is accessible only within this method

    if (x > 5)
    {
        int y = 20; // y is accessible only within this if block
        Console.WriteLine(x); // x is accessible here
    }

    // y is not accessible here
    Console.WriteLine(x); // x is still accessible here
}
```

### 2. Method Scope

Variables declared within a method are only accessible within that method. This includes local variables and method parameters.

```csharp
public void MethodScopeExample()
{
    int a = 5; // a is accessible only within this method
    int b = 10; // b is accessible only within this method
    Console.WriteLine(a + b);
}
```

### 3. Class Scope

Variables declared at the class level are accessible throughout the class. These are called fields. They can be accessed by all methods within the class, provided they respect the access modifiers (like `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `public`).

```csharp
public class ClassScopeExample
{
    private int classLevelVariable = 30; // class-level variable

    public void Method1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(classLevelVariable); // accessible here
    }

    public void Method2()
    {
        classLevelVariable = 50; // can be modified here
        Console.WriteLine(classLevelVariable);
    }
}
```

### 4. Namespace Scope

Namespace scope encompasses all the classes and methods within a namespace. Members declared within a namespace are accessible to all classes within the same namespace.

```csharp
namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class ClassA
    {
        public void MethodA()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello from MethodA");
        }
    }

    public class ClassB
    {
        public void MethodB()
        {
            ClassA a = new ClassA();
            a.MethodA(); // accessible because ClassA is in the same namespace
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Global Scope

Global scope refers to variables and methods that are accessible throughout the entire application. In C#, global variables are not directly supported as in some other languages, but static members of a class can serve a similar purpose.

```csharp
public static class GlobalVariables
{
    public static int GlobalVar = 100;
}

public class ClassC
{
    public void AccessGlobalVar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(GlobalVariables.GlobalVar); // accessible here
    }
}
```

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Variable Shadowing**: A variable declared in an inner scope can hide a variable with the same name declared in an outer scope.

```csharp
public void VariableShadowingExample()
{
    int x = 5;
    {
        int x = 10; // This x shadows the outer x
        Console.WriteLine(x); // Prints 10
    }
    Console.WriteLine(x); // Prints 5
}
```

2. **Access Modifiers**: Scope is also influenced by access modifiers. For example, a `private` field is only accessible within its class, while a `public` field is accessible from anywhere.

3. **Static Members**: Static fields and methods belong to the class itself rather than any instance of the class, thus having a broader scope.

```csharp
public class StaticExample
{
    public static int StaticField = 42;

    public static void StaticMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Static method called");
    }
}

public class AnotherClass
{
    public void AccessStaticMembers()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(StaticExample.StaticField); // accessible without creating an instance
        StaticExample.StaticMethod();
    }
}
```

Understanding scope helps in managing the accessibility and lifetime of variables and methods, leading to better-organized and more maintainable code. Keep practicing with different scopes to become proficient in managing and utilizing them effectively in your C# applications.
